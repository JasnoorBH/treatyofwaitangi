        - Not only is Waitangi engaging from an educational point of view, but it's also a very beautiful place to explore. You can take a tour(opens in new window) along the Waitangi River, ride the tracks of the Waitangi Mountain Bike Park, or explore the small semi-formal garden that surrounds the Treaty House to the 6-kilometre forest walk that leads to Haruru Falls, the natural environment is spectacular. The shoreline provides a continuously changing panorama of the bay where warriors, whalers, sailors and settlers arrived in New Zealand.
